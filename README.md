# Slick theme for NodeBB with a spin

I love NodeBB and the Slick theme, but I wanted to add my additions.

Features:
* Category description, if not blank, will appear under the category title.
* Move the category title to the top above 'New Topic' & subcategories.
* If category privileges doesn't allow topics to be created or viewed, hide the 'no topics alert' and the tools 'watching | sort by | topic tools'.
* Added the 'Categories.tpl' page to the widgets section.
    ** Allows this page to have header and sidebar widgets

This list will expand as I add features. If you like where this is going, feel free to fork and pull request!
